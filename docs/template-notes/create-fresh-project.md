# Create a fresh project

Using React CLI.

Note that this project will not be up to date in terms of structure as dependencies, in comparison to the original Create React App repo was is used to generate the code for this repo.

So you may prefer to generate a fresh app using the command below from the [Getting Started](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started/) guide.

```sh
$ npx create-react-app my-app
$ cd my-app
$ yarn start
```

Then add the docs and CI setup based on this React Quickstart template repo.
